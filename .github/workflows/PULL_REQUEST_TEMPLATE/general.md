# Business logic change (General)

Changes in business logic involve modifications to the rules and processes that govern how data is handled and processed within the system. These changes can have a significant impact on the functionality and behavior of the system.

- Understand the Context of the Change:
    - Make sure you fully understand the purpose and scope of the change. What problem is being solved? What improvements are expected?
- Review Documentation:
    - Update and revise API documentation to reflect changes in business logic. This includes endpoint descriptions, parameters, responses, and usage examples.
- Maintain Consistency:
    - Verify that changes are consistent with the rest of the system. For example, if you change how commissions are calculated, make sure that all parts of the system that rely on this logic are updated.
- Exhaustive Testing:
    - Unit Testing: Make sure that each unit of code works correctly in isolation.
    - Integration Testing: Verify that the different modules of the system work correctly together.
    - Regression Testing: Make sure that changes do not introduce new bugs in existing functionality.
    - End-User Testing: Simulate real-world scenarios to ensure that the business logic meets user requirements.
